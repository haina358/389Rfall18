If I were to find myself in such a position, I would begin by notifying my boss in a private setting. This is to make sure he is aware of the security issue and is able to make a decision of whether or not to address It without public pressure. If after notifying my superior of the issue and he decides to disregard the potential risks, then I will proceed to evaluate my other options which include informing the public or leaving the organization altogether. To me, informing the public is not a feasible option as it only tarnishes the reputation of the company. Additionally, I would be essentially compromising the perceived security of the ECU as hackers could use this information to exploit the firmware. As one can see, informing the public directly may not be in our best interest. The second option is something that I would honestly consider because it shows that my input as an employee is not valued and that management doesn’t care for the safety of its consumers. This is would be a more viable option for me because I wouldn’t want to be associated with an organization that had its firmware exploited simply due to negligence.

Even though my company is unwilling to postpone the ECU’s release, I still believe there is a civic responsibility on my part to ensure consumers are aware of the risks. To slightly address that I will inform other trustworthy developers of the situation and ask for their advice. If nothing substantial comes out of it and I see that a security breach is imminent, I will simply leave the organization. By entrusting others with the information, management included, I would not be solely responsible for the consequences that occur should the company decide to neglect the severity of an exploit.
